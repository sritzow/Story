Once upon a time I was
working on a piece of code.
After hours and hours of thinking, 
I decided I would have no
more and trashed that junk. Beginning
anew, I worked through my task
improving upon the effencientcy. After much 
deliberation, I came to a conclusion
that what I have been working
on just might be impossible. I 
google away from hours upon hours 
I search for a solution to
my problem. Browsing forum to forum
I find the same useless solutions
that just happen to not work.
In a last ditch effort, I
try one last thing. Changing the
logic over and over my problems
