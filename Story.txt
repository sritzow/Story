Once upon a time I was
working on a piece of code.
After hours and hours of thinking, 
I decided I would have no
more and trashed that junk. Beginning
anew, I worked through my task
improving upon the effencientcy. After much 
deliberation, I came to a conclusion
that what I have been working
on just might be impossible. I 
google away from hours upon hours 
I search for a solution to
my problem. Browsing forum to forum
I find the same useless solutions
that just happen to not work.
In a last ditch effort, I
try one last thing. Changing the
logic over and over my problems
fix themselves, but to my suprise
more problems come my way. Thus
I start my journey for a
new solution. Line by line I
search my code trying to find
an error in my ways, but
what I find is a headache
of confusion. Could it be me
just not looking at the right
thing, Or is my logic flawed?
Google my friend show me the
way for I have no idea
what could be wrong. Maybe a
parentheses or two surrending that code,
or even one if statement gone
wrong. Debug I must as I
run through my code, no compile
errors to work from my work
is hard. After lots of time
I find my error, a minor
mistake I must have overlooked. Why
must it be the easy mistakes
that take the most to solve.
Perhaps it is the fact that
the easiest of mistakes look the
most correct to you as it
is just a minor fault in
your thinking. Now is the time
to test my work that I
have completed. Hopefully I reach the
result of what I wrote.
