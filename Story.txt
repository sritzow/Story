The problem 
with coming 
up with 
a story 
for your 
own personal 
experience
is that 
whatever seems 
like a 
good story 
in memory 
doesn't always 
read as
a good 
story on 
paper. But 
here  it goes:
Once upon a time I was
working on a piece of code.
After hours and hours of thinking, 
I decided I would have no
more and trashed that junk.I 
run screaming as loud as I
could for the car and lock
myself in. Beginning
anew, I worked through my task
improving upon the effencientcy. After much 
deliberation, I came to a conclusion
that what I have been working
on just might be impossible. Afterall,
perfecting teleportation just might
not be a reality for many more centuries. I 
google away from hours upon hours 
I search for a solution to
my problem. Browsing forum to forum
I find the same useless solutions
that just happen to not work.
In a last ditch effort, I
try one last thing. Changing the
logic over and over my problems
fix themselves, but to my suprise
more problems come my way. Thus
I start my journey for a
new solution. Line by line I
search my code trying to find
an error in my ways, but
what I find is a headache
of confusion. Could it be me
just not looking at the right
thing, Or is my logic flawed?
Google my friend show me the
way for I have no idea
what could be wrong. Maybe a
parentheses or two surrending that code,
or even one if statement gone
wrong. I debug on the fly as I
run through my code, and am rewarded with
no compile errors for my work.

I find my error, a minor
mistake I must have overlooked. To
this day things like this still
happen, though not always to this
degree. Why must it be the easy mistakes
that take the most to solve.
Perhaps it is the fact that
the easiest of mistakes look the
most correct to you as it
is just a minor fault in
your thinking. Now is the time
to test my work that I

Hopefully I reach the result of what I wrote.
